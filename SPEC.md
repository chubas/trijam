Phase 2 -> Board and basic unit description/interactions
Phase 3 ->

## Phase 1

The game is a digital board game, being a strategy, turn-based, multiplayer and
some-sort-of-combat game. It is inspired by games such as Slay, Hexxagon, and
a bit by more sophisticated tactical games like X-Com, Final Fantasy Tactics,
and something about card and unit games such as Duelyst, HS and Prismata.

## Phase 2

- A game match consists on a board, with players' units on the map.
- The game's objective is to defeat the opponents (still deciding on the
  specifics).
- Each game has a map. The map is a portion area of a triangular grid, where
  the units can be placed on the vertexes, and the triangles inside hold
  a territory.
- Each territory can be attacked or defended by a unit.
- There are different types of unit with different attack and defense values.
  (or some sort of value that allows battling. It may be fixed and implicit,
  like Slay, or varied and dynamic, like Duelyst)

## Phase 3

# Coordinate system

The coordinate system for the triangular grid consists as following

___\/____\/____\/____\/__
   /\    /\    /\    /\
  /  \  /  \  /  \  /  \
 /____\/____\/____\/____\
 \    /\    /\    /\    /
